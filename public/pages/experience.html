                    I worked on a team of two other engineers (one frontend, one backend) to create an insurance
                    platform for customers to easily buy our products and agencies to easily sell our products. We also
                    had an admin platform for our admins to manage the customers and agencies. Some projects I worked
                    on include creating the renewal system, automating underwriting for driving insurance & renter’s
                    insurance, parsing driver’s license number from a photo to pass to underwriting, and implemented
                    WireMock for local and development testing to mock external API responses.

                    I also worked on integrating automated regression testing into the web deployment plans,
                    creating automated SSIS processes with BIML, and converting our codebase and deployment plans
                    from Subversion to Git through bash and batch scripting.
