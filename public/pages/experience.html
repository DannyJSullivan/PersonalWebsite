                    As a software engineering intern for the Enterprise Business Systems team, I worked in various parts of the codebase, such as payment processing, finance, and booking. I worked directly alongside the team on several projects, as well as a few individual projects. I was able to complete many bug fixes for the team, as well as create new scripts, tests, and functionalities for new and existing code.
