                    My sophomore year, I took a software engineering course, which was by far the
                    most beneficial course I have ever taken. We worked in teams of ten to compete
                    weekly and see who could make the best application. We applied agile development
                    methodologies and software design patterns in Java to create an indoor pathfinding
                    application, map builder, and integrated service modules for Brigham & Women's main
                    hospital campus. To create this application, we gathered software requirements through
                    surveys, interviews, and brainstorming, as well as created user stories, scenarios,
                    and storyboards.

                    In my group, I worked as both a software engineer and test engineer. I was responsible
                    for creating user classes, the technology ticket API, integrating other team's APIs,
                    kiosk timeout feature, and the live clock. I also assisted in creating the UI, login
                    handler, pathfinding, node and edge translation, and Epic integration. As a test engineer,
                    I wrote the unit tests for the UI, database, and other functionality through the app.
