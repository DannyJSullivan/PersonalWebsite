                    My sophomore year, I took a software engineering course, which was by far the
                    most beneficial course I have ever taken. We worked in teams of ten to compete
                    weekly and see who could make the best application. We applied agile development
                    methodologies and software design patterns in Java to create an indoor pathfinding
                    application, map builder, and integrated service modules for Brigham & Women's main
                    hospital campus. To create this application, we gathered software requirements through
                    surveys, interviews, and brainstorming, as well as created user stories, scenarios,
                    and storyboards.

                    In my group, I worked as both a software engineer and test engineer. I was responsible
                    for creating user classes, the technology ticket API, integrating other team's APIs,
                    kiosk timeout feature, and the live clock. I also assisted in creating the UI, login
                    handler, pathfinding, node and edge translation, and Epic integration. As a test engineer,
                    I wrote the unit tests for the UI, database, and other functionality through the app.

                    My major qualifying project was to adapt the original Dr. Swarm application from
                    a tablet application to an application for the Magic Leap One augmented reality
                    headset. Dr. Swarm is an application that allows for users to visualize information
                    about a robot swarm, as well as interact with it. The basic functionality of the
                    application can be seen in <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrQVi_bqj30" style="color: #63BCFF; text-decoration: underline;">
                    this video</a>, but is primarily moving individual robots, selecting groups of robots
                    and moving those as a group, as well as moving objects which will then send robots
                    to move the object to the desired location.

                    Our goal when re-writing the application for the Magic Leap headset was to make a more
                    intuitive and immersive experience for users. To do this, we used the Magic Leap
                    controller as primarily control functionality, as well as the option for gestures
                    for ease of control. Using these functionalities, we were able to replicate the
                    basic original application functionality successfully. One of the main features
                    we were looking to add was voice control. This would allow the user to just
                    tell the robots to perform actions and have those actions take place. Unfortunately,
                    due to COVID-19, we were unable to fully implement this feature, as well as test
                    the full application in person. However, the application was tested extensively in
                    simulation and was proven to work.

                    In my senior year, I took a course in Webware, which focused on developing web applications
                    in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. For our final project, we had to develop a web application
                    of our choice. My group decided to create a peer to peer book exchange service, with the purpose
                    of exchanging required college textbooks so that students could save money. This application
                    was made using HTML and CSS as the frontend, Javascript for the backend functionality, and used
                    MongoDB as a database.

                    For this project, I worked primarily as a data and backend engineer. I designed the database,
                    as well as created all of the backend functionality required to make database calls. This included
                    collections for books, users, and messages. Users are able to be created and logged in,
                    books are able to be added, deleted, searched, and transferred between users, and users are able to
                    message each other to organize a book exchange.

                    In my senior year, I also took a course on Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing. For our final project,
                    we decided to create Goat Books in an Android application form. It maintained the same features
                    as above for the most part, other than messaging, which was replaced by email. This app was written
                    in Java in Android Studio with a Google Firestore database. One addition that was made was the ability
                    to add a book by scanning it's barcode. Scanning the barcode returns an ISBN, which is then sent
                    to the Google Books API so that the information can be put into the database with no discrepancies.
                    We also added an area for users to manage transactions, both outgoing and incoming, allowing them to
                    delete sent requests or accept or deny incoming requests.

                    as well as created all of the backend functionality required to make database calls. This also required
                    multiple collections, such as for users, books, requests, and accepted requests. The book object stored
                    a list of its users, so that when a request for a book was made, it was sent out to all the users
                    who are owners of it. Once a user accepts a request for that book, the other requests are
                    automatically deleted so that there are no requests when it is no longer needed. Once this request
                    is accepted, the user has the ability to email the other user to organize a transaction for the desired
                    book.
